# Quasi-static Grasping Library

## Dependencies
The linear complementarity Problems (LCPs) generated by this library are solved using [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ferris/path.html](PATH). `pathlcp` will need to be in the MATLAB path for the examples to run correctly.

## Functionality
Quasi-static LCPs can be solved directly, both in the velocity-based formulation (`finiteFB`) as well as the time-stepping formulation (`finiteFBTS`). There is additional structure to repeatedly solves the time-stepping problem over a trajectory with positional feedback in `simulateQuasiStatics`.

## Examples
There are three examples included, each of which may be run with the parameter `true` to generate a corresponding video:
- `slidingCircle`: A circle is pushed along three different paths by two fingers.
- `slidingCircleWithWall`: A circle is rolled against a wall.
- `polygonalPegInHole`: A rectangual peg is inserted into a slot with a 1% width tolerance.
